	* gfortran: some changes to make compatible with gfortran (132 width, f90 -> F90 for preprocessing)
	* svn: use svn:keywords property to update revision in the code

2008-08-19    <willem@sara.nl>

	* timings: added timings: 0: no timings, 1: timings output
	spaceparams.F90: in the block-collect subroutines, use 3rd dimension  of b, not of a
	* parallel: Lots of changes, all in the parallel code.	It was necessary to put many parallel code in the subroutines, and I removed the calls to distribution routines between the subroutine calls.
	* xmpi: The most important parallel routines are now xmpi_shift and xmpi_getrow. The latter is only used in two occasions, but it is possible that the use of that subroutine is needed in more places. See xmpi.F90 for descriptions.

	* xbeach: setup the gnu autotools build
	* gfortran: changed file saving from binary to unformatted. Saving	binary files is not supported using the gfortran compiler.

	* xbeach: initial version.
