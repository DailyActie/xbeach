Main improvements of Easter 2012 version over Quatorze Juillet 2010 version

Usability

Curvilinear grids
Input grid and depth from Delft3D
Netcdf output
Visualization by Quickplot
Much improved Matlab toolbox under Openearth

Waves

Bed friction in short wave propagation
Ship waves
Beach Wizard
Second order upwind short wave propagation
Refraction problem with large wave angles solved (no more negative longshore currents)
Superfast 1D using only 1 grid row for profile models
Daly et al (2011) breaking model
Stationary mode optimized, much faster


Flow

Offshore boundary condition (epsi=-1 default) more robust w.r.t. mean flow effects
Snellius refraction in case of only one directional bin


Sediment

Avalanching for multiple sediment fractions


Informatics

Restructured directories and make, solution files
Updated default settings (recommendation: try defaults by throwing out all non-model specific input)
Numerous bug fixes
